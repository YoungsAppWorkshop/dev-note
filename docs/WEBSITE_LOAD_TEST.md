* TPS (Transaction Per Second)
  - The number of transactions executed per second
  - It can be calculated based on how many transactions are executed over a certain duration of the test and then calculate it for a second
  - If a vuser executes 6 transactions every minute, then the TPS would be 6 transactions/60 sec = 0.10 TPS
