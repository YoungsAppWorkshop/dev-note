## Lesson 1: Ideation & Validation

* The Entrepreneur's Mindset
  - Locket
    - Aggressive, impatient go-getter
    - Get the gratification from building stuff
    - Failure is necessary, but need to know why it failed
    - It's best if you fail quickly
  - Optimizely
    - Resilience: Being able to bounce back after something doesn't go your way
    - Real understanding of what the customer wanted: Get outside of your room and start talking to people    


* What's the Big Idea?
  - Solve a novel problem
  - Extend a current solution
  - Disrupt an industry


* Types of Ideas
  - Simplify: Trying to make a process/task much easier for your user
  - Me Too: Take a current idea and bring it to a new market
  - Virtualize: Move an activity to the online space
  - Remix
  - Mission Impossible


* Brainstorm
  - Never say no
  - No bad ideas
  - Defer judgment
  - Avoid buzz words
  - Be energized
  - Be supportive


* Generate Ideas
  - One minute: Brainstorm any problems that come to mind
  - One minute: Brainstorm any solutions that come to mind
  - Tips for generating ideas
    - Find your motivation
    - KISS. Keep it simple, stupid
    - Don’t worry if your idea exists already
    - Browse the top 100 apps in the App Store or Google Play Store, and write down any ideas you have as a result
    - Keep in mind that there is a difference between free & paid apps


* Evaluate and Triage Ideas
  - Is your idea
    - a vitamin or painkiller?
    - easy to monetize?
    - simple?
    - personally related?
  - Do you have
    - follow through?
    - a big market? (lower and upper estimates for the size of the market)
    - secret sauce?
  - Questions
    - What is the product called?
    - Who are the users and how many of these users exist?
    - What problem does the product solve and how valuable is the solution to users?
    - How does the product solve the problem and what does the solution look like?
    - Why is your approach durably different than the competition?
    - When will the product ship and what are the major milestones?


* What is User research?
  - Definition
    - A discipline that is providing insights into product users, their perspectives and abilities to the right people at the right time
  - 3 BIG questions
    - What do people need?
    - What do people want?
    - Can they use the product?
  - Tips
    - List all your assumptions
    - You want to make sure of yourself about the questions you need answers.


* User Research without a Prototype
  - Email: Open rates, click through rates, and task completion rates for recipients all provide insight into whether your idea has value.
  - Google AdWords: Purchase advertisements that target searches relevant to your business. You can know what language customers are using to find solutions related to your business, and you can measure click through rate to determine customer interest in the copy of the ad.
  - Landing Pages: You can build a landing page to complement your advertising. The landing page can be your proof of concept and allow you to test click through rates on buttons such as “buy now”, “register” or “share”. The clicks serve as further validation of the idea.
  - Buttons: Add buttons for specific features or services that your business will provide. Even if the buttons aren’t functional, you can measure interest and collect emails or other demographics on users. If a design element (such as a button) doesn't actually work on your website, be sure to indicate that to users and explain to users why it isn’t working.


* Learn about Market Demands and Trends
  - Keyword Evaluation (Google AdWords): What are people searching for? What do you notice after filtering the high volume keywords?
  - Content Competition (Google Search): What type of content appears in your searches? (articles or companies) Is this consistent for other keyword searches related to your idea?
  - Geographic Validation (Google Trends): Where do people live who are searching for related keywords? What barriers might exist to deliver the product or service?
  - Social Media Validation (Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest): What volume of people use keywords related to your idea? How are users talking about related ideas? Handy for communicating your idea and for marketing materials later.


* Analyze the Competition
  - [WhoIs](https://www.whois.net/)
  - [SimilarWeb](https://www.similarweb.com/)
  - [SEMRush](https://www.semrush.com/)
  - [The Difference Between Paid and Organic Search Results](https://web.archive.org/web/20150424032957/http://info.barcelonacreative.com/blog/bid/268929/The-Difference-Between-Paid-Search-Results-Organic-Search-Results)
