## The Importance of Good Code

The best way to improve process is

- Technical level: Test-Driven Development
- Management level: Agile principles, Scrum Framework

### What is technical debt

Technical debt is a metaphor created by Ward Cunningham,Â an American computer programmer: "A little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite... The danger occurs when the debt is not repaid. Every minute spent on not-quite-right code counts as interest on that debt."

#### Causes of technical debt

- Lack of talent
- Lack of time
- Lack of morale

#### Consequences of technical debt

- Development speed will slow down
- More manpower (and thus money) and time will need to be spent to implement the same set of features
- More bugs, which consequently means poorer user experience, and more personnel required for customer service

#### Repaying technical debt through refactoring

Clean means:

- Well-structured
- Well-documented
- Concise
- Well-formatted and readable
